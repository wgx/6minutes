Lawyers, particularly those in private practice, often record their time in six-minute increments, which is also known as 1/10th of an hour. This practice is primarily used for billing clients based on the time spent on their cases. Here's why lawyers use six-minute increments:

## Billing:
Six-minute increments allow for a practical way to track and calculate billable hours. Each six-minute unit represents 1/10th of an hour, making it easy to translate time spent into monetary charges. 

## Client Transparency:
This method provides a clear and detailed breakdown of the work done for a client, which is helpful for invoicing and explaining the costs associated with legal services. 

## Efficiency:
While lawyers may perform many tasks throughout the day, recording time in six-minute intervals ensures even minor tasks are accounted for without excessive padding or rounding. 

## Standard Practice:
This method is widely adopted in legal practice, making it a standard approach for timekeeping and billing in law firms, according to legal resources.
